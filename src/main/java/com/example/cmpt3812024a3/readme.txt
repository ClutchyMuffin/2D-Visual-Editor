Export the ZIP file to get the project folder.
Open the folder as a project in IntelliJ (File->Open->Select-the-folder).
Choose 'Trust this project' if a window pops up.
Wait for a few seconds till everything loads and the configuration is built.
Can be started by running the EventDispatchSimulator class.

I chose to create a separate controller for the MiniView, as handling all its interactions in the
normal AppController was getting too complicated and difficult to handle.

Status of each class:

01. AppController            = Functional
02. Box                      = Functional
03. DetailView               = Functional
04. EditorApp                = Functional
05. EntityModel              = Functional
06. InteractionModel         = Functional
07. MainUI                   = Functional
08. MiniView                 = Functional
09. MiniViewController       = Functional
10. Portal                   = Functional
11. Subscriber               = Functional
